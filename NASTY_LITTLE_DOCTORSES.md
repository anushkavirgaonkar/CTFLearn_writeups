####So, there were these Medical Doctors, 5 to be exact. They had to encrypt all of their passwords with something. The 5 M.D.'s were named Bob, Joe, Mike, Sarah, and Jill. Get what I'm hinting at yet? `bafa3de6dac066cebe8c0e5670d98935` is your flag, although indirectly. ;)

By `Medical Doctors, 5 to be exact`, `5 M.D.'s` we get that the given text is the MD5 hash of the flag. Use [this](https://www.md5online.org/md5-decrypt.html) to crack the hash.
