#### I got a new hard drive just to hold my flag, but I'm afraid that it rotted. What do I do? The only thing I could get off of it was this:  
`01000011010101000100011001111011010000100110100101110100010111110100011001101100011010010111000001110000011010010110111001111101`

Nothing to do with hard drives or any other complicated stuff here. Convert the given binary message to ASCII. Use an [online converter](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-hex-bin-dec-converter.html) for this and get the flag.
