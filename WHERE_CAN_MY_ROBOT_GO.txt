Web robots or web crawlers traverse through websites in a defined and automated manner. Every website has it's robots.txt. This page lists the pages within the website that are not allowed to be traversed by the web robots. They tell the robot where not to go. In this challenge, we get enough hints to tell us that the flag has to do something with robots.txt. We view the website robots.txt by going to:

websitename/robots.txt

After going to https://ctflearn.com/robots.txt, we find that /70r3hnanldfspufdsoifnlds.html is disallowed. After visiting https://ctflearn.com/70r3hnanldfspufdsoifnlds.html we get the flag.
